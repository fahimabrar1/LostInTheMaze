# Lost In The Maze
This project demonstrates pathfinding using the A* algorithm in a Pacman-inspired environment. It includes a grid setup that can be dynamically changed, random obstacles that may block the path (refresh to test with a clear path grid), and a visualization of the A* algorithm finding the shortest path.

## Features

1. **Grid Setup**: The project utilizes a grid setup that can be modified dynamically to represent different environments.

2. **Random Obstacles**: Random obstacles are generated on the grid, sometimes blocking the path. Refreshing the grid allows testing with a clear path.

3. **A* Algorithm**: The A* algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path from the start to the target position on the grid.

4. **Pacman Visual**: The project contains a Pacman scene without AI behavior or enemies but with a working Pacman as in the original game.

5. **Pathfinding Visualization**: The pathfinding process can be observed in the scene view, showing how the algorithm navigates the grid to find the optimal path.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your_username/pacman-pathfinding.git

2. Open the project in your preferred Unity editor (2022.3.15f1).

3. Navigate to the "LostInMaze Test Task Scene" to visualize the pathfinding process in a grid setup.

4. Modify the grid setup as desired and observe how the A* algorithm adapts to find the shortest path around obstacles.

5. Refresh the grid to test different scenarios with clear paths.


To navigate Pacman in the maze using the keyboard or arrow keys, please access the "Pacman Scene" within the project. This scene aims to faithfully replicate the original mechanics of Pacman. Note that AI behavior is currently under development and will be implemented in future updates.
